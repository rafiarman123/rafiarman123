### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, It's me, Rafi Bin Arman
#### Business Intelligence Analyst

As BI Analyst, I apply my passion and skills in data analytics to support the company's digital transformation and innovation in the healthcare sector. I prepare and harmonize data of various KPIs in a Python-based analytical table in Databricks, extract and analyse data with SQL in Teradata, and visualize the results using Power BI. I also leverage machine learning to identify drivers of spare parts costs and optimize the inventory management.

I am pursuing my master's degree in business analytics at Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, where I learn and explore various topics such as operations research, blockchain, programming languages, and data science. I have a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Rajshahi.  I have also obtained multiple certifications in Python, SQL and Power BI. I have a keen interest in voluntary activities, global affairs and social issues.

Skills: Python / SQL / Power BI / MS Excel
